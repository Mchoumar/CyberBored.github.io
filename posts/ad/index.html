<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2019">Installation Link</a>, Either press the provided link or search for Windows Server 2019 and choose ISO downloads:</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/0.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is finished, head on to Vmware and follow the following steps.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/1.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After pressing create link you will be presented with this windows.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/2.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Choose I will install the operating system later, because if you choose ISO installation immediately you might face some installation error later on after lunching the server.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/9.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/4.png" alt="Shell"></p>

<p>The storage can be changed depending on your Disk and PC.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/6.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Make sure to add two network adapters, one that is dedicated for the internet that is going to be running NAT, and one dedicated for the internal VMware network (Host-Only). After setting up everything, right click on the newly created virtual machine for windows server 2019 and press settings .</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/10.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>or you can left click on the windows machine and you can find setting also under play the virtual machine.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/11.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After you lunch the settings window, go to the CD/DVD (SATA) and choose Use ISO image file, then browse to where you downloaded your windows server ISO image and choose it.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/12.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/13.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then after setting everything up correctly, we lunch the virtual machine. Note that once you lunch the Windows Server press enter in the machine window, because otherwise it would show a timeout error. It should show you an installation window, and that&rsquo;s how you would know that it was setup correctly.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/14.png" alt="Shell"></p>

<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/15.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Finally setup your admin account, and you will be done with the installation.</p>
<h2 id="-windows-10">-Windows 10:<a href="#-windows-10" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10">Installation Link</a> Either press the provided link or search for Windows 10, and download Create windows 10 installation media:</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/0.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is complete, lunch the installation media and follow the steps:</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/1.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/2.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/3.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is completed for the ISO file, follow the same steps for the machine setup as Windows server, but make sure to choose ISO file during the initial setup.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/9.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/10.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>The system configurations can be changed depending on your PC. After the setup is complete, lunch the machine and proceed with the setup</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/4.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>You can choose either Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro. Then proceed with the installation normally and setup a random Microsoft account or proceed without one by choosing limited options.</p>
<h1 id="windows-server-2019-setup">Windows Server 2019 setup:<a href="#windows-server-2019-setup" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>After installing the requirements, we should setup everything to be able to start. We will start first by setting up windows server 2019 by creating a new virtual machine on your Virtual Machine, I chose VMware since it get updated more often, which is more secure and less vulnerable. Next, we should configure the network adapter setting for the internal network. To configure the network, we open control panel &ndash;&gt; Network and Internet &ndash;&gt; Network and Sharing Center &ndash;&gt; Change adapter settings and you should have the following page.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/16.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>I renamed the two network adapters to internal and internet so that I would be able to tell the difference between them. To know which I simply pressed right click &ndash;&gt; status.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/11.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/12.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/13.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>The one that has IPv4 connectivity is the one that is running on NAT, while the one that isn&rsquo;t connected to anything is the internal internet adapter. After configuring the name, right click again on the internal adapter and choose properties, then go to the IPv4 and choose properties.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/17.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/18.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Use the following IP addresses is where we configure the IP for the network.
After setting up your IP address the subnet mask should be assigned automatically according to the IP you setup and we won&rsquo;t assign a default gateway, because the domain controller will serve as a default gateway, it has two NICs one on the internet and one on the inside and that&rsquo;s why the internal NIC won&rsquo;t have a default gateway. For the DNS server, when we install the active directory, it automatically installs the DNS and that&rsquo;s why it will use itself as the DNS server. To achieve that we can either put its own IP address or the loop address 127.0.0.1.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/19.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<h1 id="setting-up-active-directory-on-windows-server-2019">Setting Up Active Directory on Windows Server 2019:<a href="#setting-up-active-directory-on-windows-server-2019" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>After setting up the network setting and configuring all the basics, it is time now to setup the main even Mr. Active Directory. To setup the AD, we need Server manager which is installed by default on the windows Server.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/20.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>And we press the second option, which is Add roles and features and you keep first two tabs on default by pressing next until you reach server selection tab.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/21.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Over here we want to choose the server we want to install the active directory on, in my case I only have one server, so I simply will select it and press next to install the AD on it. Then choose Active Directory Domain services, then continue with next until you reach the result tab and press install.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/22.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/23.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is done, close the installation page and you will have a warning sign on the flag located on the navigation bar, which says that you installed the AD Domain Services, but you didn&rsquo;t configure it yet. Press on the flag then promote this server to a domain controller.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/24.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After you open the new tab to configure the AD, we want to choose a Add a new forest and choose a domain name then press next and setup a password for your service restore mode, then leave everything else on other tabs on default until you reach the Prerequisites Check where it will check if you have everything setup correctly, if it is all setup correctly you will be able to start the installation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/25.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/26.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is done, it will ask you to restart your system to install and apply all changes and you simply press close.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/27.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the setup is done you will have a new account depending on the domain name you chose, in my case it was MR\ADMINISTRATOR. Login into the account and lets setup a new user, so that we refrain from using the built in admin account. To create the new account, press windows logo &ndash;&gt; Windows Administrative Tools &ndash;&gt; Active Directory Users and Computers.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/28.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/29.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After lunching the Active Directory Users and Computers, we want to create a new unit, press right click on the domain you created &ndash;&gt; New &ndash;&gt; Organizational Unit.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/30.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then name your new unit.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/32.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After we create the new unit we want to create a new user inside of the unit, press right click on the unit you created &ndash;&gt; New &ndash;&gt; User. Choose a name and password for your user, best practice in organizations is to put the first initial of the role - and the first name of the person</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/31.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/33.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/34.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>The options under the password are optional, I turned off user must change password because it is a lab, and password never expires because it is a lab and I don&rsquo;t want to always change it in a lab.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/35.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After we have created our user, we need to configure user permissions to admin level, press right click on the user &ndash;&gt; Properties &ndash;&gt; Member of &ndash; &gt; Add. And type into the object name domain admins then switch to the new created user.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/36.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/37.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/38.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/39.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next, we need to install RAS/NAT, which is Remote Access Server/Network Address Translation to allow our windows client to be on the network privately and still connect to the internet. Same as last time with setting up the AD Domain Service, we choose Add roles and features in the server manager then leave everything on default for the first two tabs, but this time we need to add Remote Access option.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/20.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/40.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>On the role service we need to add the routing feature, then we install the new features.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/41.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the installation is done, we close the installation window. This time instead of pressing the yellow warning we need to choose tool tab &ndash;&gt; Routing and Remote Access.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/43.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then to configure the network to be active and able to connect to the internet, right click on DC (local) &ndash;&gt; Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/44.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then press next, and choose Network address translation (NAT) to enable us to connect to the internet while staying private.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/45.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then, choose use this public interface to connect to the internet and choose the one that we named <em>INTERNET</em> and is connected to the internet through NAT, then press next and finish to setup everything.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/46.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>You should have a similar window if everything was setup correctly.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/47.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/48.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>For the next step, we want to setup the DHCP on our Domain Controller to allow our Windows 10 client to get on the internet. To setup the DHCP, we have to go back to the Add roles and features and we keep everything for the first two tabs on default, choose our server and add DHCP Server on the Server Roles, then next and install. After installation is done close the installation.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/49.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>It is time now to configure the DHCP, press Tools tab &ndash;&gt; DHCP. And you should have the following window.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/50.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Choose either IPv4 or IPv6 &ndash;&gt; right click &ndash;&gt; new scope.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/51.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/52.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next, setup the scope name, for me I just named it after the range of the IP.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/53.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then, we need to setup the range of the IP that we want to give to our clients, depending on the size of your organization you can give out more IPs, but for now we can just keep it between 100-200.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/54.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next, we have this window, which is just asking what IPs you want to exclude or reserve, in my case I left it empty as I don&rsquo;t need to exclude any.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/55.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next window, we have the Lease Duration, which reserve an IP for a period of time for the user.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/56.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next window, asks us if we want to configure the DHCP option, which tells the client which server to choose for DNS or Gateway, and since we want to allow the client to get on the internet, we should choose yes.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/57.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Over here we are choosing the default IP for the gateway to allow the client to connect to the internet, and I chose the Domain Controller&rsquo;s IP, since I want to be the gateway, then press add. For the following windows keep everything on default and finish the setup. After the setup is complete, we want to authorize our server and refresh it so that it comes online. To do so, right click on the DC server and press authorize, then right click again and refresh</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/58.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>And we should see something like this.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/59.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>For testing purposes we will temporarily turn on the ability to browse the internet on the DC without interruptions by security popups.</p>
<p>To allow access to the internet, navigate to server manager and press configure this local server &ndash;&gt; IE Enhanced Security Configuration and turn off both available options.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/60.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/61.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/62.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next, we need to download a PowerShell script which Josh Madakor provide us that will help us to create all users Link Reference. After the installation is finished, save the zip file somewhere easy to access and extract the files inside. Navigate to the name.txt and add a name of a user you want to create (Optional). After you setup the name of users you would like to add, navigate to the windows icon &ndash;&gt; Windows PowerShell Folder &ndash;&gt; PowerShell ISE (Run as administrator).</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/63.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After you lunch the PowerShell, open 1_CREATE_USERS file that we downloaded by opening the folder button that has a red circle in the picture bellow and run the command in the picture bellow &lsquo;Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted&rsquo; and press yes to all. Note: in a real environment don&rsquo;t allow any unknown PowerShell file to run unrestricted, as this would cause security breach in case of a malware was present.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/64.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Simple explanation for the command:</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/65.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Next, navigate to the folder we downloaded to be able to pull the names that are in the name.txt file and run the script. You can either let the script run or just stop it after certain amount of users are created.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/66.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After the script is done you can navigate back to Active Directory Active Users and Computers to check all the created users.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/67.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>For the final step on DC we need to create a router on the DHCP server. To create it we just need to navigate back to the DHCP &ndash;&gt; DC server that we created &ndash;&gt; IPv4 &ndash;&gt; Server Options &ndash;&gt; right click &ndash;&gt; Configure Options &ndash;&gt; 003 Router &ndash;&gt; and add the default gateway IP address. Then restart the server.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/68.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/69.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%20server/70.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Windows 10 Client:
Now all that&rsquo;s left for us to do is just configure the windows 10 client by following the steps in the requirements to set the initial setup.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/16.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>Then we need to setup the users, navigate to settings &ndash;&gt; System &ndash;&gt; About &ndash;&gt; Rename this PC (advanced) &ndash;&gt; Change… &ndash;&gt; add the name of the computer and the domain &ndash;&gt; add user name and password of one of the users we added.</p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/17.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/14.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/15.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p><img src="../../../static/images/AD/windows%2010/20.png" alt="Shell"></p>
<p>After you setup the user the pc will restart and you have to enter the user name and password, then everything should be setup. You can check if the user is connected by using ipconfig and pinging mydomain.com.</p>
