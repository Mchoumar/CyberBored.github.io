<ol>
<li>Broken Access Control: Applications require strict access control to achieve proper security measures for systems and data. Broken Access Control allows attackers to gain access to sensitive and business critical applications.</li>
<li>Cryptographic Failures: Is a critical part of securing web applications. Failures in cryptography can lead to sensitive data exposure and other critical information leakage.</li>
<li>Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.</li>
<li>Insecure Design: This risk Focuses on design flaws and the problems that occur when applications are not designed with security in mind.</li>
<li>Security Misconfiguration: Web applications can be easily misconfigured to allow attackers easy access to your data. With more shifts into highly configurable software, this risk has become even more important for applications.</li>
<li>Vulnerable and Outdate Components: Many components of modern web applications can commonly present security risks that administrators and managers need to understand. Today&rsquo;s applications rely on third-party libraries and components and it&rsquo;s hard to keep everything updated and patched correctly.</li>
<li>Identification and Authentication Failures: User identification and authentication mechanisms can be easily exploited. This risk highlights the need for standardized frameworks.</li>
<li>Software and Data Integrity Failures: Many application environments make assumptions related to software updates, critical data and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.</li>
<li>Security Logging and Monitoring Failures: Logging and monitoring failures, couples with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence and tamper, extract or destroy data.</li>
<li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): SSRF is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick the server-side application to make requests to an arbitrary domain. This can lead to sensitive data leakage or command execution.</li>
</ol>
<p>To build a secure web application, you should use the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) to follow the detailed documentation about securing your web application Reference Link.</p>
<h1 id="1-broken-access-control">1-Broken Access Control:<a href="#1-broken-access-control" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<pre><code>• Authorization is the process where requests to access a particular resource should be granted or denied.
• Authentication is providing and validating identity (Who are you?)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="types-of-access-control">Types of access control:<a href="#types-of-access-control" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<pre><code>• Role-Based Control (RBAC): Access decisions are based on an individual's roles and responsibilities within the organization or user base.

• Discretionary Access Control (DAC): A means of restricting access to information. This is based on the identity of users and/or membership in certain groups. Information owner typically discretion to change access rights at any time.

• Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Ensures the enforcement of security policy doesn't rely on user compliance. MAC secures information by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of sensitivity a user is operating at.

• Permission Based Access Control: The abstraction of application actions into a set of permissions. A permission be represented simply as a string-based name, for example, &quot;READ&quot;.
</code></pre>

<pre><code>• Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL, internal application state or the HTML page, or simply using a custom API attack tool.

• Allowing the primary key to be changed to another user's record, permitting viewing or editing someone else's account.

• Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in, or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.

• Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control taken or a cookie or hidden field manipulate to elevate privilege, or abusing JWT invalidation.

• CORS misconfiguration allows unauthorized API access.

• Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user. Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT, and DELETE.

<pre><code>• With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
• Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse them through the application, including minimizing CORS usage.
• Access controls should enforce record ownership rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, delete any record.
• Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata and backup files are not present within web roots.
• Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate.
• Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.
• JSON Web Tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.
• Developers and QA staff should include functional access control unit and integration tests.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="2-cryptographic-failures">2-Cryptographic Failures:<a href="#2-cryptographic-failures" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Cryptography is the study/practice of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from Greek word kryptos, which means &lsquo;hidden&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-failures">Cryptographic failures:<a href="#cryptographic-failures" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<pre><code>• The focus of this OWASP risk is on failures related to cryptography (or lack thereof).
• When cryptography fails (or is not implemented correctly), it can lead to exposure of sensitive data and other serious problems.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="determine-the-protection-needs-of-data-in-transit-and-at-rest">Determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest:<a href="#determine-the-protection-needs-of-data-in-transit-and-at-rest" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Is any data transmitted in cleartext?

• Are any old or weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols used either by default or in older code?

• Are default crypto keys in use? Are weak crypto keys generated or reused? Are proper key management or rotation missing? Are crypto keys checked into source code repositories?

• Is encryption not enforce? Are any HTTP headers (browsers) security directives or headers missing?

• Are the received server certificate and the trust chain properly validated?

• Is randomness used for cryptographic purposes that was not designed to meet cryptographic requirements?

• Are deprecated hash functions such as MD5 or SHA1 in use? Are non-cryptographic hash functions used when cryptographic hash functions are needed?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Ephemeral is just a word that means it doesn&rsquo;t last for very long, it&rsquo;s very short lived.</p>
<h4 id="to-protect-yourself-from-these-types-of-vulnerabilities-or-attack">To protect yourself from these types of vulnerabilities or attack:<a href="#to-protect-yourself-from-these-types-of-vulnerabilities-or-attack" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Classify data processed, stored or transmitted by an application. Identify which data is sensitive according to privacy laws, regulatory requirements or business needs.
• Don't store sensitive data unnecessarily. Discard it as soon as possible or use PCI DSS-compliant tokenization or even truncation. Data that is not retained cannot be stolen.
• Make sure to encrypt all sensitive data at rest.
• Ensure up-to date and strong standard algorithms, protocols and keys are in place; use proper key management.
• Encrypt all data in transit with secure protocols such as TLS with forward secrecy (FS) directives like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
• Disable caching for response that contain sensitive data.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="3-injection-attacks">3-Injection Attacks:<a href="#3-injection-attacks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<pre><code>• Allows attackers to relay malicious code through an application to another system.
• Calls to the operation system via system calls, the use of external programs via shell commands as well as calls to backend databases.
• If application uses an interpreter of any type, there is a danger of introducing an injection vulnerability.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example attack</strong>:
Username: John&rsquo; OR 1=1&rsquo;
Password: passwd</p>
<h4 id="ldap-overview">LDAP overview:<a href="#ldap-overview" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).
• Open and cross-platform protocol used for directory services authentication.
• Communication language that applications use to communicate with other directory services servers.
• Directory services store user IDs, passwords, computer accounts and share that information with other entities on the network.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example syntax</strong>: find(&quot;(&amp;(cn=John)userPassword=mypass))&quot;)</p>
<h4 id="ldap-injection">LDAP injection:<a href="#ldap-injection" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>We have this URLL <a href="http://www.example.com/ldapsearch?user=">http://www.example.com/ldapsearch?user=</a><em>.
Bcomes this: searchfilter=&quot;(cn=</em>)&quot;.</p>
<p>Suppose a web application uses a filter to match LDAP user/password pair.
Searchlogin= &ldquo;(&amp;(uid-&quot;+user+&rdquo;)(userPassword={MD5}&quot;+base64(pack(&ldquo;H*&quot;,md5(pass)))+&rdquo;))&quot;;</p>
<p>Attacker submits this username: <em>)(uid=</em>))(|(uid=*
And this password:password</p>
<p><strong>Becomes this</strong>:
Searchlogin=&quot;(&amp;(uid=<em>)(uid=</em>))(|(uid=*)(userPassword={MD5}X03MO1qnZdYdgtfeulLPmQ==));</p>
<p>This means that when we use the logical operator &amp; it merges (uid=<em>)(uid=</em>) together and it becomes true, which confuses the protocol and logs us in.</p>
<h4 id="determine-the-protection-needs">Determine the protection needs:<a href="#determine-the-protection-needs" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Search the source code for all calls to external resources.
• Many languages have multiple ways to run external commands.
• Review code and search for places where input from HTTP request could get into these calls.
• An application is vulnerable to attack when:
	○ User-supplied data is not validated, filtered or sanitized by the application.
	○ Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used in the interpreter.
	○ Hostile data is used within Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.
	○ Hostile data is directly used or concatenated, where the command contains both structure and hostile data in dynamic queries, commands or stored procedures.

<pre><code>• Avoid accessing external interpreters wherever possible.
• Carefully validate the data to ensure that it does not contain any malicious content.
• Structure requests in a way that ensures supplied parameters are treated as data rather than as potentially executable content.
• A web application should run with only the privileges it needs to perform its function.
• For any residual dynamic queries, escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.
• Use LIMIT and other SQL controls within queries to prevent mass disclosure of records case of SQL injection.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="4-insecure-design">4-Insecure design:<a href="#4-insecure-design" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>This category focuses on risks related to design and architectural flaws, with a call for more use of threat modeling, secure design patterns and reference architectures.</p>
<pre><code>• Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as &quot;missing or ineffective control design&quot;.
• Differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects.
• A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited.
• Insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.
• Lacks of business risk profiling inherent in the software or system being developed leads to insecure design.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="secure-design">Secure design:<a href="#secure-design" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<pre><code>• Secure design is a culture and methodology that constantly evaluates threats and ensures code is robustly designed and tested to prevent known attack methods.
• Threat modeling should be integrated into refinement sessions(or similar activities).
• In the user story development, determine the correct flow and failures states, ensure they are well understood and agreed upon by responsible and impacted parties.
• Analyze assumptions and conditions for expected and failures flows, ensure they are still accurate and desirable.
• Determine how to validate the assumptions and enforce conditions needed for proper behaviors.
• Secure design is neither an add-on nor a tool that can add to software.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="secure-development">Secure development:<a href="#secure-development" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<pre><code>• Secure software requires a secure development life cycle.
• Engage security specialists from the beginning of a software project throughout the whole project and maintenance of your software.
• Use tools like the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) to help structure your secure software developments efforts.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="determine-the-protection-needs-1">Determine the protection needs:<a href="#determine-the-protection-needs-1" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Establish and use a secure development life cycle.
• Establish and use a library of secure design patterns.
• Use threat modeling for authentication, access control, business logic and key flows.
• Integrate security language and controls into user stories.
• Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application (from front-end to back-end).
• Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are resistant to the threat model. Compile use cases and misuse cases for each tier of your application.
• Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers, depending on the exposure and protection needs.
• Limit resource consumption by user or service.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="5-security-misconfiguration">5-Security Misconfiguration:<a href="#5-security-misconfiguration" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Configuring your devices is a major key when it comes to security. Huge majority of attacks happens because a device is kept on default configuration or default username and password or vulnerable port left open or unpatched. These might lead to someone breaking into your system and exposing your data, or making your device into a bot or a zombie under their botnet for DDOS attacks.</p>
<h4 id="determine-the-protection-needs-2">Determine the protection needs:<a href="#determine-the-protection-needs-2" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.
• Unnecessary features are enabled or installed.
• Default accounts and their passwords still enabled and unchanged.
• Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messaged to users.
• For upgraded systems, latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.
• The security settings in the applications servers, application frameworks, libraries, databases not set to secure values.
• The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.
• The software is out of date or vulnerable.

<pre><code>• A segmented application architecture that provides effective, secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization or cloud security groups.
• Sending security directives to clients (content-security-policy, XSS protection, HSTS).
• Encrypt data at rest to protect from exfiltration.
• A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is appropriately locked down.
•  Development, QA and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to setup a new secure environment.
• A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.

<p>Vulnerability is a weakness in the computational logic found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</p>
<h4 id="determine-the-protection-needs-3">Determine the protection needs:<a href="#determine-the-protection-needs-3" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<pre><code>• If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both client-side and server side). This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies.
• If software is vulnerable, unsupported or out of date. This includes the OS, web/application server, database management system (DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments and libraries.
• If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to security bulletins.
• If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a days or months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.
• If software developers do not test the compatibility of libraries.
• If you do not secure the components' configurations.

<pre><code>• Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files and documentation.
• Continuously inventory the version of both client-side and server-side components and their dependencies.
• Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in the components.
• User software composition analysis tools to automate the process.
• Subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use.
• Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified, malicious component.
• Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not create security patches for older versions. If patching is not possible, consider deploying a virtual patch to monitor, detect or protect against the discovered issue.

•  Do not ship or deploy with any default credentials, particularly for admin users.
• Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed passwords against a list of the top 10,000 worst passwords.
• Align password length, complexity and rotation policies with NIST guidelines.
• Ensure registration, credential recovery and API pathways are hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same messages for all outcomes.
• Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts. Log all failures and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute-force or other attacks are detected.
• Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a new random session ID with high entropy after login.
• Session IDs should not be in the URL, should be securely stored and should be invalidated after logout, idle and absolute timeouts.

<h1 id="8-software-and-data-integrity-failures">8-Software and Data Integrity Failures:<a href="#8-software-and-data-integrity-failures" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<pre><code>• A new category for 2021 focuses on making assumptions related to software updates, critical data and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.
• One of the highest weighted impacts from common Vulnerability and Exposures/Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVE/CVSS) data.
• Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
• An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries or modules from untrusted sources, repositories and content delivery networks (CDNs).
• An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code or system compromise.
• Many applications now include auto-update functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied to previously trusted application.
• Attackers could upload their own update to be distributed and run on all installations.

<pre><code>• Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from expected source and has not been altered.
• Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as NPM or Marven, are consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile, consider hosting an internal known-good repository's vetted.
• Ensure that a software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used to verify that components do not contain known vulnerabilities.
• Ensure there is a revies process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.
• Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration and access control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing the build and deploy processes.
• Ensure that unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to untrusted client without some form of integrity check or digital signature to detect tampering or replay of serialized data.

<pre><code>• Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins and high-value transactions are not logged.
• Warning and errors generate no, inadequate or unclear log messages.
• Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.
• Logs are only stored locally.
• Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective.

<h2 id="ssrf-brief-explanation">SSRF brief explanation:<a href="#ssrf-brief-explanation" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<pre><code>• SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
• It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN or another type of network access control list (ACL).
• As modern web applications provide end users with convenient features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario.
• In a typical SSRF attack, the attacker might cause the server to make connection to internal-only services within the organization's infrastructure.
• In other cases, they may be able to force the server to connect to arbitrary external systems, potentially leaking sensitive data such as authorization credentials.

<p><strong>From the network layer</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>• Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks to reduce the impact of SSRF.
• Enforce &quot;deny by default&quot; firewall policies or network access control rules to block all essential intranet traffic.
• Hints:
	○ Establish an ownership and life cycle for firewalls rules based on applications.
	○ Log all accepted and blocked network flows on firewalls.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>From the application layer</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>• Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data.
• Enforce the URL schema, port and destination with a positive allow list.
• Do not send raw responses to clients.
• Disable HTTP redirections.
• Do not mitigate SSRF via the use of a deny list o regular expression. Attackers have payload list, tools and skills to bypass deny lists.
