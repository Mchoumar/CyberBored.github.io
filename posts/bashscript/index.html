                I started by checking out what shell is running in our terminal
                using echo $SHELL.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic0.png" alt="Shell" /></p>
              <p>
                Then using the command <strong>ls</strong> I listed the
                available files and directories in our working directory, and
                after that I listed the long format of the directories and files
                including the hidden ones using <strong>-la</strong>. After
                checking the current data available using ls, I typed
                <strong>pwd</strong> to check my current working directory. Next
                using <strong>cd /</strong> I navigated to the root directory
                which is located at the top of all directories, which contains
                sensitive files.

              <p>
                I used <strong>touch</strong> command to create a file name
                myBashScript then used <strong>ls -l myBashScript</strong> to
                list my new file and check that it was created successfully, I
                decided next that I would like to change the name of the file
                using the command
                <strong>mv myBashScript muchBetterName</strong>. Finally, I
                removed the file using rm muchBetterName.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic1.png" alt="Commands" /></p>
              <p>
                Next, I tried cat command which stands for concatenate, to list
                the contents of a file and redirect the contents into another
                file. First, I made a file called myNewFile.txt and using the
                command
                <strong
                  >echo &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; &gt; myNewFile.txt</strong
                >
                to output the phrase hello world into the file, then
                <strong>cat myNewFile.txt</strong> to output the content on the
                screen. Next, I used the command
                <strong>cat myNewFile.txt &gt; test.txt</strong> and finally
                displayed it using cat.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic2.png" alt="Commands1" /></p>
              <p>
                Using more and less you can view all the content of the file or
                portion of them. I used nano to edit the contents of the files I
                created.

              <p>
                I tried creating a new directory using mkdir and moved it to a
                new directory called backups and created two new files into it,
                then we deleted the whole file using rm -r backups because rmdir
                only deletes empty directories.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic3.png" alt="create" /></p>
              <p>
                I tried to find a directory using find command, which displayed
                a bunch of errors then tried it again but I added 2&gt;dev/null
                which outputs all the errors into the file called null. By using
                * to be able to get all files and directories that has backup in
                their names.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic4.png" alt="find" /></p>
              <p>
                Next I tried the grep command to find specific files that
                contains regular expressions.
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic5.png" alt="grep" /></p>
              <p>
                I learned that using <strong>!ls</strong> I can access the
                content since last time I used ls. Using
                <strong>history</strong> I can check the history of all commands
                I used in my CLI and <strong>man</strong> is used to check the
                manual of a specific command.
              </p>
              <h1 id="aliases">
                Aliases:<a href="#aliases" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"

              <p>
                Alias is a shortcut we can use to access a command that is
                frequently used, for example, <strong>ll</strong> which is an
                alias for the command ls <strong>-alF</strong>, we can check
                what an alias is for by typing <strong>alias ll</strong>. We can
                create aliases by going to the file called
                <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> which is checked when the shell
                is first lunched and checks the <strong>.bashrc</strong> file.
                To create the aliase, we should run the following into the
                <strong>.bash_aliases</strong> file:
              </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/bash/pic6.png" alt="alias" /></p>
              <p>
                And replace the command that is after fbackup with the command
                you want to create an aliase for, and replace fbackup with the
                name that you desire for the alias command. Note: When you first
                create an alias the shell won&rsquo;t recognize it, since it
                only looks into the file once when it is first lunched, to make
                it look into the file and recognize the new alias we can type
                <strong>source .bash_aliases</strong>.

              <p>
                I started writing my first bash script. First, I created a file
                using nano and then using #!/bin/bash also known as the Shebang
                which specifies that the shell type is bash. Next, I wrote a
                comment to specify what this script is for so that in the future
                I can understand what it is made for. Then I set up variables
                and stored directory path into them. After that, to make sure
                that the file names aren&rsquo;t the same, I assigned a variable
                that stores the date and I used back tick to let the shell know
                that it should execute the command that is inside of the back
                ticks, file name, and the file extension type, then combined
                them into a variable called FILE_NAME. After the script was
                create, I changed the file user permission using chmod to be
                able to execute the script.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                Then I added tar to my script, which stands for tape archive and
                is used to create Archive and extract the Archive files. Using
                the command bellow allowed me to create and extracted the
                archived file using the following flags:
                <strong>-c</strong> which creates an archive by bundling files
                and directories together. <strong>-f</strong> Specifies the
                filename of the archive to be created or extracted.
                <strong>-z</strong> Uses gzip compression when creating a tar
                file.

                Final step, I started by creating an if else statement to check
                if the script is working and sends it to the specified email
                using the mail command else it will output that at that date
                something went wrong into the error.log file. Then, I used
                <strong>crontab -e</strong> to automate the process.
